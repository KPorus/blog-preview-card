## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I focused on creating a clean layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also learned how to style a hover effect for interactivity. For example:

```html
<h1>HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
```

```css
h1:hover {
  color: var(--yelllow);
}
```


### Continued development

For future projects, I plan to continue improving my responsiveness and accessibility skills, as well as exploring animations to enhance user experience.
